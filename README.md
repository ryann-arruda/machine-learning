# Machine Learning

This repository was created based on information collected during my Machine Learning studies. Therefore, it will be constantly updated with new information as my knowledge improves.

## Definition

**Machine Learning** consists of studying and building intelligent agents, which can perceive the environment through sensors and act in the environment through actuators.

Another possible definition for **Machine Learning** is an algorithm that responds efficiently to situations that have not been presented.

## Types of Machine Learning

* **Supervised Learning:** The learning model receives a set of inputs consisting of data and class labels.

    * **Classification:** The set of values is nominal and finite;

        **Example:** Classify whether an instance is spam (A) or not spam (B).
